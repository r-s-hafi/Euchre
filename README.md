# Euchre
Euchre is a card game popular in Michigan.

One of the projects in the course EECS 280 - Data Structures and Algorithms @umich is to make functional back-end euchre. I never took the class but wanted to see if I could do it.

Started with backend - sqlite3 and python, working on frontend now - FastAPI, Jinja2, Bulma.
